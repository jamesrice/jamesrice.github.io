                People who think generative AI is ‘pretty good’ need to admit
                they’ve been riding the coattails of mediocrity all along. You
                have to realize most people can’t distinguish human creativity
                from an LLM fever dream— taste died the moment we traded
                complexity for convenience. Creatives need to stop howling that
                AI lacks ‘soul,’ because when the bar is set crushingly low,
                what’s there to save? Ditch the Folgers and embrace that a
                faceless algorithm grinding single-origin beans is at least as
                ‘artisanal’ as so-called masterpieces ever were. If you’re still
                clutching your nostalgia, you need to confess you never tasted
                the difference back in the day anyway, and now generative AI is
                here to prove it.
